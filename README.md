## Installation

No third-party applications were installed during the making of this website.

## Usage

When the user clicks on the "Start Quiz" button, he/she is presented with one question. After the user answers that question, he/she is presented with another question, and another question, and ANOTHER question. 

If the user answers a question incorrectly, the timer deducts 15 seconds from the score.

After the timer reaches 0 OR if the user answers all questions, the high scores page is displayed, where the user can input his/her initials. After that, the high scores are displayed, giving the user 2 choices:
1. Go back and try again
2. Clear all high scores from the list

PLEASE NOTE: While trying to do a demonstration of the website (as shown in the video), there are some names mentioned. PLEASE IGNORE THE NAMES. THEY WERE USED FOR TESTING PURPOSES WHEN DOING THE PROJECT. 

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work... with one issue: 

1. I had trouble with the JavaScript portion of the project. My colleague, Leo, helped me out a lot. His thoughts are on full display in the script.js file.

2. All questions are made possible by the "Javascript Quiz" page on w3Schools. (https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JS) 10 questions are on full display in the script.js page.

3. I have tried ENDLESSLY to store an array in localStorage. I had issues with doing this until I checked out this link (https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/store-array-or-object-in-localstorage-using-javascript#:~:text=To%20store%20an%20array%2C%20an%20object%20or%20an,method%20to%20store%20the%20JSON%20string%20in%20localStorage). Now, it's in my Javascript project. Projects made simple. 

4. Even though I knew how to do localStorage (thanks to Prefessor Maddatu), I confirmed my knowledge by reading about Client-Side Storage(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Client-side_storage). 2 birds, one stone, and everything is in script.js.

5. I had to open links for the high scores page going to the index.html page. Stack Overflow provided me with the answer on how to do that. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10226507/javascript-opening-a-link) This is on full display in my script.js page. 

6. In order to store the initials, I had to use a textbox to input them. Luckily, this link (https://sebhastian.com/javascript-textbox/#:~:text=You%20can%20create%20a%20textbox%20using%20JavaScript%20in,created%20to%20%22text%22%20using%20the%20Element.setAttribute%20%28%29%20method.) helped me out with that. You can see it in my script.js file.

7. For testing purposes, I have included a function that highlighted key names from One Piece. This is (c) 2023 Eiichiro Oda/Shueishia (or however you spell that). All rights reserved.
